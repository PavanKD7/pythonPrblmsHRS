Given the names and grades for each student in a class of  students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

N=int(input())
marks=[]
records=[]
for i in range (N):
    name=input()
    score=float(input())
    
    
    records.append([name,score])
    marks.append(score)
#print(records)

# print(marks)

marks=sorted(set(marks))
# print(marks)

m=marks[1]
name=[]
for val in records:
    if m==val[1]:
        name.append(val[0])
        # print(name)
        
name.sort()
# print(name)
for nm in name:
    print(nm)
